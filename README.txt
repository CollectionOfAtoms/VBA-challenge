I ran calcstocks on each of the spreadsheets in the /Resources folder.

calcStocks.bas can be imported as a module in visual basic by selecting file -> import
calcStocks.txt contains the same code, but will need to be copy/pasted into its own module in order to work.  

Both the basic assignment and the challenge have been completed, and will run automatically if you run the calcStocks module.
